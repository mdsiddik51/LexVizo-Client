# LexVizo - LegalEase Digital Legal Representation Platform

LexVizo is a premium, high-performance web platform designed to seamlessly connect individuals and businesses with top-tier legal professionals. It streamlines client intake, lawyer discovery, retainer payment processing, and case management under a secure role-based access system.

## 🚀 Purpose
Traditional legal hiring is often limited to law firms or physical consultations. LexVizo democratizes access to legal aid, enables emerging lawyers to reach clients globally, and provides a secure, streamlined hiring experience using the modern MERN stack.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Public Legal Discovery Catalog**: Discover, search, filter by specialization/availability, and sort expert lawyers by hourly rates. Includes responsive mobile (2-column), tablet (3-column), and desktop (4-column) grids.
- **Hiring Retainer Pipelines**: Clients can hire lawyers directly, with requests pending review.
- **Secure Stripe Checkout Integration**: Pay retainer fees online. The checkout interface locks and disables payment indicators once settled successfully.
- **Client Evaluation and Feedback**: Share reviews and assessments. Reviews are restricted solely to users with verified active hiring logs.
- **Nested Dashboard Control Panels**:
  - **User (Client)**: Track hiring histories, update display avatars via imgBB API, modify profile names, and manage review comments.
  - **Lawyer**: Action incoming client hiring requests (Accept/Reject), update practice categories, bio, hourly fee, and supplemental service packages.
  - **Admin**: Oversee the user list registry (change roles or delete accounts), audit global Stripe payment histories, and view analytical totals.
- **Enterprise Security Verification**: Employs BetterAuth for OAuth/Google/credential registrations and session tokens for role-specific API calls.
